This exploit for a newbie like me, looks pretty intense.

Right off the bat, I have no idea what these strings mean. I'm thinking they are commands or are encoded to get around something or something like this.

This is going to be fun xD.

1. Create the Exercise_file_1.txt to show the exploit I'm looking at. (Picked at random using searchsploit on my Kali VM)

2. Line by line decode what I'm looking at

3. Try and modify the code 

4. Hopefully end up with new knowledge about how exploits are written and why they are written they way that they are.

5. BONUS: create my own exploit off this one if possible. Still a newbie so this could take me working through a couple dozen of these first to figure the ins and outs.
